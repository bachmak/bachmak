ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Dima, a passionate software developer.<br>
In my work, I predominantly use C++ but I'm absolutely eager to learn and use other languages and technologies.<br><br>

ðŸ‘ˆ Currently, the primary goal of my github is to share my learning experience with fellow programmers.<br>
We'll see how it goes. Hope this will bring some inspiration to you and me!
